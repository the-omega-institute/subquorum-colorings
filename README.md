# Sub-quorum colorings: hypercubes, boundary matchings, and grids

[![Verification](https://github.com/the-omega-institute/subquorum-colorings/actions/workflows/verify.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/the-omega-institute/subquorum-colorings/actions/workflows/verify.yml)

Research sources and reproducibility materials for **From hypercubes to grids:
sub-quorum colorings and structural bounds**, with contributions by Wenlin
Zhang (National University of Singapore; The Omega Institute) and Haobo Ma
(ChronoAI Pte Ltd; The Omega Institute).

**Start with the [current mathematical results](docs/GRID_RESULTS.md)**:
the profile proof of the known grid dissociation formula, directional matching bounds, and the
five-sixths estimate for mixed directions. This companion includes complete
proofs and extends the earlier manuscript, which covers the hypercube,
structural results and exact strip certificates.

The starting result resolves Conjecture 6.4 of Rafik Sahbi's
[Sub-quorum colorings of graphs, arXiv:2609.25128v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2609.25128v1):
the sub-quorum coloring number of the n-dimensional hypercube is 2^(n-1)
for **every n >= 2**, with a dimension-independent Lean proof.

Starting from this solved family, the project advances two research directions:

1. **Rectangular grids:** use exact strip certificates and the boundary viewpoint
   to seek a proof of Sahbi's formula at arbitrary width and length.
2. **Structural characterization:** determine conditions for psi_sq=beta_2,
   using the signed boundary theorem as a sufficient mechanism and the grafted
   tree families as explicit obstructions.

The [research agenda](docs/RESEARCH.md) connects current results to the next
mathematical targets. The manuscript follows the same progression from the
hypercube solution to these geometric and structural questions.

## Results and verification

| Result | Scope | Verification |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Hypercube coloring number | All dimensions n >= 2 | Lean 4, pinned Mathlib; original modules from trureturing |
| Boundary matching | Feasible (T,M) in graphs with signed adjacency S^2=dI, d>=2 | Written energy estimate and Hall argument |
| Bipartite signed graphs and Cartesian products | All graphs satisfying the stated hypotheses | Written proof and exact matrix controls |
| Exact grafting theorem | Every finite nonempty base graph F | Written proof; tree-DP cross-checks |
| Unbounded gap on subcubic trees | R(P_k), every k>=1; gap floor(k/3) | Written proof; checks k=1..30 |
| Rectangular grid formula | Widths 8,9,10,11 at every positive length | Exact full-vector certificates, independently recomputed |
| Known grid dissociation number beta_2=F | Every positive width and length | New row-profile proof with equality information; exact finite checks |
| Directional Omega_H=Omega_V=F | Every positive width and length | Written ladder-rigidity argument; exact finite checks |
| Mixed matching bound with coefficient 5/6 | Every positive even-by-even rectangle | Written residual-geometry proof; exhaustive and constructed controls |

The Lean theorem explicitly states psi_sq(Q_n)=2^(n-1). The beta_2 identity
was already established by Sahbi and also follows from the written proof;
beta_2 is not defined in the archived Lean module. The subsequent structural
and grid results are not yet Lean formalized. The unrestricted mixed-direction
grid coloring formula remains open.

The [long-corridor follow-up](docs/RESIDUAL_CORRIDORS.md) constructs fork-free
positive residual components of arbitrary length and proves an objective-preserving
replacement when the adjacent band is blank. It also records a bounded search
for simple all-capacity-one paths without internal matching edges.

The [boundary-aware compensation note](docs/CROSS_COMPONENT_COMPENSATION.md)
proves a filled-corridor adjacent-band inequality, including occupied bands and
capacity-two passages. An explicit family shows why outward attachments to
saturated tiles require a boundary correction. Its written proof, sharp examples
and coordinate verifier are separate from the current joint manuscript.

The [compensation transport follow-up](docs/COMPENSATION_TRANSPORT.md) proves a
neutral-band propagation lemma and constructs fork-free equality configurations
whose compensating component lies arbitrarily far from the positive component.
It excludes fixed-radius charging of the initial negative residual contributions.

The grid extension uses Sahbi's Omega reduction and max-plus method. Huang's
signed hypercube matrix is the key input to the hypercube proof. Tree-result
priority is still to be compared with the earlier caterpillar work cited
by Sahbi; the draft makes no historical priority claim about that work.
